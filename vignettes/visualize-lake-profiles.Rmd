## Overview 

In this post, we're going to cover how to visualize lake profiles using `ggplot2`. Let's jump right in!

## Taking a look at the data 

It's always a good idea to take a look at the data before we try to plot anything: 
```{r glimpse}
library(r4es)
dplyr::glimpse(university_lake)
```

`glimpse()` is a really handy function to get a snapshot of what your data look like. In our case, it looks like each row is a discrete *depth* and columns 3-28 are different *parameters* collected at each depth.

<br>

## Our first figure  

We'll start with a simple figure by making creating a temperature profile. When making any figure with `ggplot2` the first step is to call `ggplot()` and map our data: 
```{r ggplot}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = university_lake)
```

<br>

You'll notice that this only gives us a blank output. That's because we only provided `ggplot2` with what data to use and not what to do with those data. In addition to providing our data, we must also tell `ggplot2` what to put on the x and y-axis by mapping to an *aesthetic*. We do this by: 
```{r aes}
ggplot(data = university_lake,  
       aes(x = temp_c, y = depth))  
```

<br>

We can see that the output changed but it's still quite uneventful. The next step is to add the first *layer* to the figure and in our case, that will be points: 
```{r points}
ggplot(data = university_lake,  
       aes(x = temp_c, y = depth)) + 
  geom_point()
```

<br>

Now there's some data! Granted the figure is ugly, but it's a start! Let's connect the dots next:
```{r path}
ggplot(data = university_lake,  
       aes(x = temp_c, y = depth)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_path()
```

<br>

When visualizing depth profiles, it is more intuitive to have the surface measurement at the top (**"0"** in our case). `scale_y_reverse()` makes that task quite simple:
```{r axis}
ggplot(data = university_lake,  
       aes(x = temp_c, y = depth)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() + 
  scale_y_reverse()
```

Much better, at least intuitively. Now we should make things less harmful to the eyes.

<br>

## Making things nice 

The first aspect I normally look to change are the axis breaks and titles I'm actually happy with the default breaks in this case, so we just need to rename the axis titles with `labs()`: 
```{r labs}
ggplot(data = university_lake,  
       aes(x = temp_c, y = depth)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() + 
  scale_y_reverse() +
  labs(x = "Temperature (°C)", 
       y = "Depth (m)") 
```

<br>

You can also add a `title`, `subtitle`, and figure `caption` within `labs()`:
```{r lab-options}
ggplot(data = university_lake,  
       aes(x = temp_c, y = depth)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() + 
  scale_y_reverse() +
  labs(x = "Temperature (°C)", 
       y = "Depth (m)", 
       title = "Temperature Profile", 
       subtitle = "University Lake, Bloomington, IN", 
       caption = "Data/Figure: Cory Sauve") 
```

<br>

If you're making a figure for a scientific report or publication, we'd want this information at the bottom: 
```{r caption-location}
ggplot(data = university_lake,  
       aes(x = temp_c, y = depth)) + 
  geom_point(size = 1.5) +
  geom_path(size = 1) + 
  scale_y_reverse() +
  labs(x = "Temperature (°C)", 
       y = "Depth (m)",
       caption = "Fig 1: Temperature profile for University Lake, Bloomington, IN") +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, vjust = -0.5, size = 12))
```

<br>

Notice the use of `theme()` here to change the position and size of the caption. We can modify almost every aspect of our figure with `theme()`. `ggplot2` also has quite a few built in themes if you're in a hurry:
```{r ggplot2-themes, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=12}
library(patchwork)

p <- ggplot(data = university_lake,  
       aes(x = temp_c, y = depth)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() + 
  scale_y_reverse() +
  labs(x = "Temperature (°C)", 
       y = "Depth (m)") 

p_grey <- p + theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, vjust = -0.5, size = 12)) + ggtitle("theme_grey()")
p_bw <- p + theme_bw() + theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, vjust = -0.5, size = 12)) + ggtitle("theme_bw()")
p_linedraw <- p + theme_linedraw() + theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, vjust = -0.5, size = 12)) + ggtitle("theme_linedraw()")
p_light <- p + theme_light() + theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, vjust = -0.5, size = 12)) + ggtitle("theme_light()")
p_dark <- p + theme_dark() + theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, vjust = -0.5, size = 12)) + ggtitle("theme_dark()")
p_minimal <- p + theme_minimal() + theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, vjust = -0.5, size = 12)) + ggtitle("theme_minimal()")
p_classic <- p + theme_classic() + theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, vjust = -0.5, size = 12)) + ggtitle("theme_classic()")
p_void <- p + theme_void() + theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, vjust = -0.5, size = 12)) + ggtitle("theme_void()")

(p_grey + p_bw + p_linedraw + p_light) / (p_dark + p_minimal + p_classic + p_void)
```

<br>

In our case, we're going to start with `theme_light()` and modify to our liking with `theme()`:
```{r final-plot, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
ggplot(data = university_lake,  
       aes(x = temp_c, y = depth)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() + 
  scale_y_reverse() +
  labs(x = "Temperature (°C)", 
       y = "Depth (m)", 
       caption = "Fig 1: Temperature profile for University Lake, Bloomington, IN") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = -1, vjust = -10, size = 14), 
        plot.margin = unit(c(1, 1, 1.5, 1), "cm"))
```

We did it! We know how have a high-quality temperature profile. If you want to save this figure, you can do so with `ggsave()`:
```{r save, eval=FALSE}
ggsave(last_plot(), filename = "path/to/save/figure.png", height = 8, width = 12, dpi = 500)
```
