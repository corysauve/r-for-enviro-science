## Overview

For this post, we're going to build off of the *Visualizing Lake Profiles* and learn how to make subplots with `patchwork`. We'll also add some annotations to the final plots.

## A quick refresher

Last time, we made a temperature profile using ggplot2:
```{r temp-profile, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
library(r4es)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = university_lake,  
       aes(x = temp_c, y = depth)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() + 
  scale_y_reverse() +
  labs(x = "Temperature (°C)", 
       y = "Depth (m)") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = -1, vjust = -10, size = 14), 
        plot.margin = unit(c(1, 1, 1.5, 1), "cm"))
```

This time we'll visualize additional parameters and compose them together into one plot. 

Let's first remind ourselves what the data look like: 
```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(university_lake)
```

## Dissolved oxygen 

Dissolved oxygen and temperature are commonly plotted on the same figure in limnology. The major flaw with doing this on the *same* axis is that it is difficult to interpret since each have different scales. Instead, plotting each parameter as a different *subplot* allows for both to be interpreted by the reader simultaneously while not running into a scale issue. 

`ggplot2` doesn't allow you to even plot two lines of differing scales on the same plot (for good reason). We could accomplish this using base graphics, but *should* we? I think not. 

Since we already have our temperature plot, we just need to replicate the same thing but with `do_mgL`. Most of our elements can be copied, but pay close attention to: 

* `aes(x = ...)`
* `labs(x = "...")`

Let's make the initial plot:
```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = university_lake, 
       aes(x = do_mgl, y = depth)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_path() +
  scale_y_reverse(name = "Depth (m)") +
  labs(x = "Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L)", 
       y = "Depth (m)") + 
  theme_light() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = -1, vjust = -10, size = 14), 
        plot.margin = unit(c(1, 1, 1.5, 1), "cm"))
```

Looks good! Now we need to save each subplot as an object to ensemble our patchwork: 
```{r}
p_temp <- 
  ggplot(data = university_lake,  
         aes(x = temp_c, y = depth)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() + 
  scale_y_reverse() +
  labs(x = "Temperature (°C)", 
       y = "Depth (m)") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = -1, vjust = -10, size = 14), 
        plot.margin = unit(c(1, 1, 1.5, 1), "cm")) 
  
p_do <- 
  ggplot(data = university_lake, 
         aes(x = do_mgl, y = depth)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_path() +
  scale_y_reverse(name = "Depth (m)") +
  labs(x = "Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L)", 
       y = "Depth (m)") + 
  theme_light() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = -1, vjust = -10, size = 14), 
        plot.margin = unit(c(1, 1, 1.5, 1), "cm"))
```

## Creating our patchwork

Now that we have our figures saved as objects (`p_temp`, `p_do`), it's time to make our final plot with the (`patchwork` package)[https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/]. 

We are only going to scratch the surface of what `patchwork` can do. Our use case is going to be quite simple (two side-by-side plots) so stay tuned for more complicated figure compositions in the future. 

To combine our figures, we simply add them together: 
```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
library(patchwork) 

p_temp + p_do
```

Congrats! We have the start of our final figure. It's really remarkable how simple `patchwork` makes this task. We can expand our initial plot to make it cleaner. 

### Combining axis titles 

In my opinion, when subplots share the same y-axis it is best to only show one. I generally preserve the left subplot and remove the right subplot:
```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
# p_temp stays the same, so no need to override
p_do <- 
  ggplot(data = university_lake, 
         aes(x = do_mgl, y = depth)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_path() +
  scale_y_reverse(name = "") +
  labs(x = "Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L)", 
       y = "") + 
  theme_light() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = -1, vjust = -10, size = 14), 
        plot.margin = unit(c(1, 1, 1.5, 1), "cm"))

p_temp + p_do
```

### Simplifying the theme 
 
You may have noticed that we have some duplicated code in `theme()`. Perhaps a cleaner alternative is to create each figure and then apply the theme after we create our patchwork: 
```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
p_temp <- 
  ggplot(data = university_lake,  
         aes(x = temp_c, y = depth)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() + 
  scale_y_reverse() +
  labs(x = "Temperature (°C)", 
       y = "Depth (m)")

p_do <- 
  ggplot(data = university_lake, 
         aes(x = do_mgl, y = depth)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_path() +
  scale_y_reverse(name = "") +
  labs(x = "Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L)", 
       y = "Depth (m)") 

plot <- p_temp + p_do 

plot & 
  plot_annotation(caption = "Temperature and oxygen profiles, University Lake, IN.") &
  theme_light() &
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, vjust = -1, size = 14), 
        plot.margin = unit(c(1, 1, 1.5, 1), "cm"))
```
